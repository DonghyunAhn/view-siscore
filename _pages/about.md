## Team Goal  

Machine learning approaches using satellite imagery provide accessible ways to infer socioeconomic measures without visiting a region. From previous research [1,2], our team has proven that computer vision models effectively analyze socioeconomic status. We are now looking for the next-level of application of our methodology, involving contributions to global problems such as climate change.
