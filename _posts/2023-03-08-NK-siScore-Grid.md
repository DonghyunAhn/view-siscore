# siScore interactive map on NK  
## Grid-level, 2016, 2019, 4 years avg  

Quick overview of prediction results over North Korea (Grid-level),  
accepted in _Nature Communcations_ (paper link : TBD)   
Codes are all available on [GitHub]("https://github.com/DonghyunAhn/development-measure")  

To comply with the file size upload limit (<100MB), we present grid-level maps for 2016, 2019, and the 4-year average (2016-2019) only.  

We are looking for alternative solutions to deliver our result with better accessibility.
